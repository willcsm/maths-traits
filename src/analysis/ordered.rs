///maximum element `M` and minimum `m`, contradicting `M + x > M + 0 = M` (if `x > 0`)
///or `m + x < m + 0 = m` (if `x < 0`). (Of course, the bitwise representations of these
///structures size limited by size, but in practice, we treat them as infinite anyway.)
///
///Futhermore, for [monoids](AddMonoid) and [groups](AddGroup), this provides a way to embed the
///[Naturals](Natural) and [Integers](Integer) into the structure respectively, and if the structure also is
///an ordered semiring with [one](One), then there is even a canonical embedding following both addition
///and multiplication rules

///The property that if `x < y`, there exists some natural `n` where `n*x = x*...*x > y`
///
///This is often interpreted as the structure having no "infinite" elements, since any element
///can be reached from any other non-zero element (even the smallest of elements) through _only_
///repeated addition.
///
///Now, it is worth noting that in practice, implementing structs _might_ still have some form
///of infinite elements, so long as they aren't "distinguished" in some way. In particular,
///IEEE floating points have INF, -INF, and NaN as standard values, all of which violate this property
///however, in order to simplify the API and still have [f32] and [f64] be considered [reals](crate::analysis::Real),
///these values are interpreted as errors. Of course, in general, new structs implementing this trait
///should avoid this if possible.
